190      * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only

192      * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
193      * need to be modified.
194      * &lt;p&gt;
195      * The method {@code clone} for class {@code Object} performs a
196      * specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
197      * not implement the interface {@code Cloneable}, then a
198      * {@code CloneNotSupportedException} is thrown. Note that all arrays
199      * are considered to implement the interface {@code Cloneable} and that
200      * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
201      * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
202      * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
203      * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
204      * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
205      * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
206      * performs a &quot;shallow copy&quot; of this object, not a &quot;deep copy&quot; operation.
207      * &lt;p&gt;
208      * The class {@code Object} does not itself implement the interface
209      * {@code Cloneable}, so calling the {@code clone} method on an object

366      * by being &lt;em&gt;notified&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;interrupted&lt;/em&gt;, or until a
367      * certain amount of real time has elapsed.
368      * &lt;p&gt;
369      * The current thread must own this object&#39;s monitor lock. See the
370      * {@link #notify notify} method for a description of the ways in which
371      * a thread can become the owner of a monitor lock.
372      * &lt;p&gt;
373      * This method causes the current thread (referred to here as &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;) to
374      * place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any
375      * and all synchronization claims on this object. Note that only the locks
376      * on this object are relinquished; any other objects on which the current
377      * thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits.
378      * &lt;p&gt;
379      * Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; then becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes
380      * and lies dormant until one of the following occurs:
381      * &lt;ul&gt;
382      * &lt;li&gt;Some other thread invokes the {@code notify} method for this
383      * object and thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
384      * the thread to be awakened.
385      * &lt;li&gt;Some other thread invokes the {@code notifyAll} method for this
386      * object.
387      * &lt;li&gt;Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
388      * thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt;.
389      * &lt;li&gt;The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.
390      * The amount of real time, in nanoseconds, is given by the expression
391      * {@code 1000000 * timeoutMillis + nanos}. If {@code timeoutMillis} and {@code nanos}
392      * are both zero, then real time is not taken into consideration and the
393      * thread waits until awakened by one of the other causes.
394      * &lt;li&gt;Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; is awakened spuriously. (See below.)
395      * &lt;/ul&gt;
396      * &lt;p&gt;
397      * The thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; is then removed from the wait set for this
398      * object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It competes in the
399      * usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
400      * object; once it has regained control of the object, all its
401      * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
402      * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
403      * method was invoked. Thread &lt;var&gt;T&lt;/var&gt; then returns from the
404      * invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the
405      * {@code wait} method, the synchronization state of the object and of
406      * thread {@code T} is exactly as it was when the {@code wait} method
407      * was invoked.
408      * &lt;p&gt;
409      * A thread can wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a
410      * so-called &lt;em&gt;spurious wakeup&lt;/em&gt;.  While this will rarely occur in practice,
411      * applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should
412      * have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition
413      * is not satisfied. See the example below.
414      * &lt;p&gt;
415      * For more information on this topic, see section 14.2,
416      * &quot;Condition Queues,&quot; in Brian Goetz and others&#39; &lt;em&gt;Java Concurrency
417      * in Practice&lt;/em&gt; (Addison-Wesley, 2006) or Item 69 in Joshua
418      * Bloch&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Effective Java, Second Edition&lt;/em&gt; (Addison-Wesley,
419      * 2008).
420      * &lt;p&gt;
421      * If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupted}
422      * by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an {@code InterruptedException}
423      * is thrown.  The &lt;em&gt;interrupted status&lt;/em&gt; of the current thread is cleared when
424      * this exception is thrown. This exception is not thrown until the lock status of
425      * this object has been restored as described above.
426      *
427      * @apiNote
428      * The recommended approach to waiting is to check the condition being awaited in
429      * a {@code while} loop around the call to {@code wait}, as shown in the example
430      * below. Among other things, this approach avoids problems that can be caused

476      * Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
477      * determines that there are no more references to the object.
478      * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
479      * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
480      * &lt;p&gt;
481      * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
482      * if and when the Java&amp;trade; virtual
483      * machine has determined that there is no longer any
484      * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
485      * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
486      * finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
487      * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
488      * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
489      * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
490      * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
491      * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
492      * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
493      * permanently discarded.
494      * &lt;p&gt;
495      * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
496      * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
497      * {@code Object} may override this definition.
498      * &lt;p&gt;
499      * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
500      * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
501      * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
502      * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
503      * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
504      * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
505      * &lt;p&gt;
506      * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
507      * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
508      * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
509      * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
510      * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
511      * at which point the object may be discarded.
512      * &lt;p&gt;
513      * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
514      * virtual machine for any given object.
515      * &lt;p&gt;
516      * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
517      * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
518      * ignored.
519      *
520      * @apiNote
521      * Classes that embed non-heap resources have many options
522      * for cleanup of those resources. The class must ensure that the
523      * lifetime of each instance is longer than that of any resource it embeds.
524      * {@link java.lang.ref.Reference#reachabilityFence} can be used to ensure that
525      * objects remain reachable while resources embedded in the object are in use.
526      * &lt;p&gt;
527      * A subclass should avoid overriding the {@code finalize} method
528      * unless the subclass embeds non-heap resources that must be cleaned up
529      * before the instance is collected.
530      * Finalizer invocations are not automatically chained, unlike constructors.
531      * If a subclass overrides {@code finalize} it must invoke the superclass
532      * finalizer explicitly.
533      * To guard against exceptions prematurely terminating the finalize chain,
534      * the subclass should use a {@code try-finally} block to ensure
535      * {@code super.finalize()} is always invoked. For example,
536      * &lt;pre&gt;{@code      @Override
537      *     protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
538      *         try {
539      *             ... // cleanup subclass state
540      *         } finally {
541      *             super.finalize();
542      *         }
543      *     }
544      * }&lt;/pre&gt;
545      *
546      * @deprecated The finalization mechanism is inherently problematic.
547      * Finalization can lead to performance issues, deadlocks, and hangs.
548      * Errors in finalizers can lead to resource leaks; there is no way to cancel
549      * finalization if it is no longer necessary; and no ordering is specified
550      * among calls to {@code finalize} methods of different objects.
551      * Furthermore, there are no guarantees regarding the timing of finalization.
552      * The {@code finalize} method might be called on a finalizable object
553      * only after an indefinite delay, if at all.
554      *
555      * Classes whose instances hold non-heap resources should provide a method
556      * to enable explicit release of those resources, and they should also
557      * implement {@link AutoCloseable} if appropriate.
558      * The {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} and {@link java.lang.ref.PhantomReference}
559      * provide more flexible and efficient ways to release resources when an object
560      * becomes unreachable.
