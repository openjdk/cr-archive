+Font Awesome Free License
+-------------------------
+
+Font Awesome Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
+commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.
+Full Font Awesome Free license: https://fontawesome.com/license/free.
+
+# Icons: CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
+In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons
+packaged as SVG and JS file types.
+
+# Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1 License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL)
+In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OFL license applies to all icons
+packaged as web and desktop font files.
+
+# Code: MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
+In the Font Awesome Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and
+non-icon files.
+
+# Attribution
+Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
+Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
+attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these
+files normally.
+
+We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
+to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
+learn about Font Awesome.
