 36 /**
 37  * Base concrete implementation of the {@code PixelSource} interface which
 38  * manages {@link Pixels} objects in the state of being consumed (uploaded
 39  * to the screen usually), in flight in the queue of upload requests, and
 40  * idle waiting to be reused for temporary storage for future uploads.
 41  * All {@code Pixels} objects currently saved for reuse will all be the
 42  * same dimensions and scale which are tracked by calling the
 43  * {@link #validate(int, int, float) validate()} method.
 44  * &lt;p&gt;
 45  * At most we will need 3 sets of pixels:
 46  * One may be &quot;in use&quot;, a hard reference stored in beingConsumed
 47  * Another may be &quot;in the queue&quot;, hard ref stored in enqueued
 48  * A third may be needed to prepare new pixels while those two are in
 49  * transit.
 50  * If the third is filled with pixels and enqueued while the previously
 51  * mentioned two are still in their stages of use, then it will replace
 52  * the second object as the &quot;enqueued&quot; reference and the previously
 53  * enqueued object will then become itself the &quot;third unused&quot; reference.
 54  * If everything happens in lock step we will often have only one
 55  * set of pixels.  If the consumer/displayer gets slightly or occasionally
 56  * behind we might end up with two sets of pixels in play.  Only when things
 57  * get really bad with multiple deliveries enqueued during the processing
 58  * of a single earlier delivery will we end up with three sets of
 59  * {@code Pixels} objects in play.
