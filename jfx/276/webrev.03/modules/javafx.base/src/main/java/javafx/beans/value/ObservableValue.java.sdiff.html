 32  * An {@code ObservableValue} is an entity that wraps a value and allows to
 33  * observe the value for changes. In general this interface should not be
 34  * implemented directly but one of its sub-interfaces
 35  * ({@code ObservableBooleanValue} etc.).
 36  * &lt;p&gt;
 37  * The value of the {@code ObservableValue} can be requested with
 38  * {@link #getValue()}.
 39  * &lt;p&gt;
 40  * An implementation of {@code ObservableValue} may support lazy evaluation,
 41  * which means that the value is not immediately recomputed after changes, but
 42  * lazily the next time the value is requested. All bindings and properties in
 43  * this library support lazy evaluation.
 44  * &lt;p&gt;
 45  * An {@code ObservableValue} generates two types of events: change events and
<span class="line-modified"> 46  * invalidation events. A change event indicates that the value has changed. An</span>


 47  * invalidation event is generated if the current value is not valid anymore.
 48  * This distinction becomes important if the {@code ObservableValue} supports
 49  * lazy evaluation, because for a lazily evaluated value one does not know if an
 50  * invalid value really has changed until it is recomputed. For this reason,
 51  * generating change events requires eager evaluation while invalidation events
 52  * can be generated for eager and lazy implementations.
 53  * &lt;p&gt;
 54  * Implementations of this class should strive to generate as few events as
 55  * possible to avoid wasting too much time in event handlers. Implementations in
 56  * this library mark themselves as invalid when the first invalidation event
 57  * occurs. They do not generate any more invalidation events until their value is
 58  * recomputed and valid again.
 59  * &lt;p&gt;
 60  * Two types of listeners can be attached to an {@code ObservableValue}:
 61  * {@link InvalidationListener} to listen to invalidation events and
 62  * {@link ChangeListener} to listen to change events.
 63  * &lt;p&gt;
 64  * Important note: attaching a {@code ChangeListener} enforces eager computation
 65  * even if the implementation of the {@code ObservableValue} supports lazy
 66  * evaluation.
