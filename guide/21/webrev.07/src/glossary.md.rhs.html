 7 [**accepted**]{#accepted} (by the CCC)
 8 :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;DRAFT&quot;, and &quot;PROPOSED&quot;. At this stage the
 9     primary goals are to ensure that the proposed changes are suitable for the
10     release in a general sense and that the requisite JCK and SQE resources will be
11     available.
12 
13 [**approved**]{#approved} (by the CCC)
14 :   The stage of the CCC process after &quot;FINAL&quot;. The CCC has approved the final
15    version of the request which permits push into the project forest.
16 
17 [**changeset**]{#changeset}
18 :   A collection of changes with respect to the current clone of a repository.
19 
20 [**development freeze**]{#developmentfreeze}
21 :   The date by which all planned work should be complete for a particular line of
22     development. After a line&#39;s development freeze, only exit-criteria bugs may be
23     fixed in that line.
24 
25 [**forest**]{#forest}
26 :   A collection of Mercurial repositories which can be managed as a set of nested
27     repositories. The name &quot;Forest&quot; originally came from the Mercurial &quot;Forest
28     Extension&quot; which can be used with some versions of Mercurial, but in general is
29     no longer recommended. The script
30     `common/bin/hgforest.sh` can be used to apply a
31     Mercurial `hg` command to all the repositories in
32     a forest.
33 
34 [**Group**]{#group}
35 :   A collection of [Participants](/bylaws#participant) who engage in
36     open conversation about a common interest. That interest may be in the
37     creation, enhancement, or maintenance of a specific body of code or it may lie
38     in other areas, e.g., quality, documentation, or evangelism. See the
39     [Group overview](../groups/).
40 
41 [**Mercurial**]{#mercurial}
42 :   A free, cross-platform, distributed source management tool. Source bundles and
43     binary packages for Mercurial are available at
44     [http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Mercurial).
45     The main Mercurial documentation is available at
46     [http://hgbook.red-bean.com](http://hgbook.red-bean.com/).
47 
48 [**Project**]{#project}
49 :   A collaborative effort to produce a specific artifact, which may be a body of
50     code, or documentation, or some other material. See the
51     [Project overview](../projects/).
52 
53 [**repository**]{#repository}
54 :   A directory tree in the filesystem that Mercurial treats specially. This tree
55    contains the source files and their revision history.
56 
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-added">57 [**trivial**]{#trivial}</span>
<span class="line-added">58 :   A change that is small, well contained, and makes no semantic changes. Typically fixing obvious typos or renaming some local identifier. Trivial changes can also be pushing an already reviewed change that was missed in an earlier push (e.g. forgot to add a file) or generated changes like an [`hg backout`](next.html#backing-out-a-change). It&#39;s up to the author of a change to claim that the change is trivial in the RFR, and it&#39;s up to the Reviewer whether to approve such a claim. A change is only trivial if the Reviewer says so. Trivial changes does not have to wait 24 hours before being pushed, and only needs one Reviewer, even in areas where stricter rules for pushing normally applies.</span>
<span class="line-added">59 </span>
60 [**webrev**]{#webrev}
61 :   A tool and its output. In JDK release forests, the script,
62     [`webrev.ksh`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/webrev/raw-file/tip/webrev.ksh),
63     examines a forest or repository to generate a set of web-based views of
64     differences.
