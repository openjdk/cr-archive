<span class="udiff-line-added">+ [**trivial**]{#trivial}</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ :   A change that is small, well contained, and makes no semantic changes. Typically fixing obvious typos or renaming some local identifier. Trivial changes can also be pushing an already reviewed change that was missed in an earlier push (e.g. forgot to add a file) or generated changes like an [`hg backout`](next.html#backing-out-a-change). It&#39;s up to the author of a change to claim that the change is trivial in the RFR, and it&#39;s up to the Reviewer whether to approve such a claim. A change is only trivial if the Reviewer says so. Trivial changes does not have to wait 24 hours before being pushed, and only needs one Reviewer, even in areas where stricter rules for pushing normally applies.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
  [**webrev**]{#webrev}

      [`webrev.ksh`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/webrev/raw-file/tip/webrev.ksh),
      examines a forest or repository to generate a set of web-based views of
      differences.
