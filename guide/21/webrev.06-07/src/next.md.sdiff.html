 19 ## Filing a Bug
 20 
 21 When a new failure is found in the JDK a bug should be filed to describe and track the issue. Depending on your role in the OpenJDK you can either use the [Bug Report Tool](https://bugreport.java.com/) or, if you are Author in an OpenJDK Project, report the bug directly in the [JDK Bug System](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/). Try to make the bug report as complete as possible to make it easier to triage and investigate the bug. It&#39;s not the reporter&#39;s responsibility to set a correct priority, but a qualified guess is always better than a default value. To help with setting the right priority consider things like how the bug impacts the product and our testing, how likely is it that the bug triggers, how difficult is it to work around the bug if it&#39;s not fixed soon, and whether it&#39;s a recent regression, since that may break existing applications. Regressions are often higher priority than long standing bugs and may block a release if not fixed.
 22 
 23 A few things to keep in mind when filing a new bug:
 24 
 25 * Before filing a bug, verify that there isn&#39;t already a bug filed for this issue.

 26 * Add relevant labels like `intermittent`, `regression`, `noreg-self` etc.
 27 * Set affects version to the JDK version(s) where the failure was seen.
 28   * If the failure is found in an update train of the JDK (e.g. 11.0.x), please make an effort to see if the bug is also present in [mainline](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk/).
 29 * In the description, always include (if possible):
 30   * full name of the failing tests
 31   * error messages
 32   * assert messages
 33   * stack trace
 34   * command line information
 35   * relevant information from the logs
 36 * If the failure is not reproducible with an existing OpenJDK test, attach a reproducer if possible.
 37 * Only set CPU and/or OS fields if the bug **ONLY** happens on that particular platform.
 38 * Always file separate bugs for different issues.
 39   * If two crashes looks related but not similar enough to for sure be the same, it is easier to close a bug as a duplicate than it is to extract the relevant info from a bug to create a new one later.

 41 ## Excluding a Test
 42 
 43 Sometimes tests break. It could be e.g. due to bugs in the test itself, due to changed functionality in the code that the test is testing, or changes in the environment where the test is executed. While working on a fix, it can be useful to stop the test from being executed in everyone else&#39;s testing to reduce noise, especially if the test is expected to fail for more than a day. There are two ways to stop a test from being run in standard test runs: ProblemListing and using the `@ignore` keyword. Removing tests isn&#39;t the standard way to remove a failure. A failing test is often a regression and should ideally be handled with high urgency.
 44 
 45 I&#39;ll say it right away so that it&#39;s not forgotten at the end: Remember to remove the JBS id from the ProblemList or the test when the bug is closed. This is especially easy to forget if a bug is closed as a duplicate or &#39;Will Not Fix&#39;.
