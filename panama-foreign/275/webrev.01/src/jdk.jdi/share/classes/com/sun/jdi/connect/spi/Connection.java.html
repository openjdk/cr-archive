 31  * A connection between a debugger and a target VM which it debugs.
 32  *
 33  * &lt;p&gt; A Connection represents a bi-directional communication channel
 34  * between a debugger and a target VM. A Connection is created when
 35  * {@link TransportService TransportService} establishes a connection
 36  * and successfully handshakes with a target VM. A TransportService
 37  * implementation provides a reliable JDWP packet transportation service
 38  * and consequently a Connection provides a reliable flow of JDWP packets
 39  * between the debugger and the target VM. A Connection is stream oriented,
 40  * that is, the JDWP packets written to a connection are read by the target VM
 41  * in the order in which they were written. Similarly packets written
 42  * to a Connection by the target VM are read by the debugger in the
 43  * order in which they were written.
 44  *
 45  * &lt;p&gt; A connection is either open or closed. It is open upon creation,
 46  * and remains open until it is closed. Once closed, it remains closed,
 47  * and any attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon it will cause a
 48  * {@link ClosedConnectionException} to be thrown. A connection can
 49  * be tested by invoking the {@link #isOpen isOpen} method.
 50  *
 51  * &lt;p&gt; A Connection is safe for access by multiple concurrent threads,
 52  * although at most one thread may be reading and at most one thread may
 53  * be writing at any given time.
 54  *

114      * A write operation only returns after writing the entire packet

116      * the entire packet has been transmitted to the target VM
117      * but rather that all bytes have been written to the
118      * transport service. A transport service based on a TCP/IP connection

120      * transmission on the network.

140      * the {@code length} field then all bytes from element
