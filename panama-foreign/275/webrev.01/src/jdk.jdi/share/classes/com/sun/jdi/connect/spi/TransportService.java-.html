 34  * A transport service for connections between a debugger and
 35  * a target VM.
 36  *
 37  * &lt;p&gt; A transport service is a concrete subclass of this class
 38  * that has a zero-argument constructor and implements the abstract
 39  * methods specified below. It is the underlying service
 40  * used by a {@link Transport} for connections between a debugger
 41  * and a target VM.
 42  *
 43  * &lt;p&gt; A transport service is used to establish a connection
 44  * between a debugger and a target VM, and to transport Java
 45  * Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets over an underlying
 46  * communication protocol. In essence a transport service
 47  * implementation binds JDWP (as specified in the
 48  * &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/../specs/jdwp/jdwp-spec.html&quot;&gt;
 49  * JDWP specification&lt;/a&gt;) to an underlying communication
 50  * protocol. A transport service implementation provides
 51  * a reliable JDWP packet transportation service. JDWP
 52  * packets are sent to and from the target VM without duplication
 53  * or data loss. A transport service implementation may be
 54  * based on an underlying communication protocol that is
 55  * reliable or unreliable. If the underlying communication
 56  * protocol is reliable then the transport service implementation
 57  * may be relatively simple and may only need to transport JDWP
 58  * packets as payloads of the underlying communication
 59  * protocol. In the case of an unreliable communication
 60  * protocol the transport service implementation may include
 61  * additional protocol support in order to ensure that packets
 62  * are not duplicated and that there is no data loss. The
 63  * details of such protocols are specific to the implementation
 64  * but may involve techniques such as the &lt;i&gt;positive
 65  * acknowledgment with retransmission&lt;/i&gt; technique used in
 66  * protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
 67  * (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0793.txt&quot;&gt; RFC 793
 68  * &lt;/a&gt;).
 69  *
 70  * &lt;p&gt; A transport service can be used to initiate a connection
 71  * to a target VM. This is done by invoking the {@link #attach}
 72  * method. Alternatively, a transport service can listen and
 73  * accept connections initiated by a target VM. This is done
 74  * by invoking the {@link #startListening(String)} method to
 75  * put the transport into listen mode. Then the {@link #accept}
 76  * method is used to accept a connection initiated by a
 77  * target VM.
