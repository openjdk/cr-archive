<span class="line-added">36  * written as property definitions and are shared between both methods. These</span>

<span class="line-added">46  * The JDK implementation of {@link org.w3c.dom.ls.LSSerializer LSSerializer}</span>

<span class="line-added">48  * of the XML Specification in handling characters output. In particular, the</span>
<span class="line-added">49  * specification defined a character range that excluded the surrogate blocks.</span>
<span class="line-added">50  * As a result, the JDK LSSerializer writes characters in the surrogate blocks</span>
<span class="line-added">51  * as Character References. Character {@code 0xf0 0x9f 0x9a 0xa9}</span>

<span class="line-added">64  *</span>
<span class="line-added">65  * &lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="line-added">66  * The JDK implementation does not follow this definition because it is not consistent</span>
