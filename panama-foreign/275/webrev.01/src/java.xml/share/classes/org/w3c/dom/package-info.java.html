26  * Provides the interfaces for the Document Object Model (DOM). Supports the
27  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/&quot;&gt;
28  *     Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Core Specification&lt;/a&gt;,
29  * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core&quot;&gt;
30  *     Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification&lt;/a&gt;,
31  * and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-LS&quot;&gt;
32  *     Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Load and Save Specification&lt;/a&gt;.
33  *
34  * @apiNote
35  * The documentation comments for the get and set methods within this API are
36  * written as property definitions and are shared between both methods. These
37  * methods do not follow the standard Java SE specification format.
38  *
39  * &lt;p&gt;
40  * Take the {@link org.w3c.dom.Node Node} TextContent property as an example, both
41  * {@link org.w3c.dom.Node#getTextContent() getTextContent} and
42  * {@link org.w3c.dom.Node#setTextContent(String) setTextContent} shared the same
43  * content that defined the TextContent property itself.
44  *
45  * @implNote
46  * The JDK implementation of {@link org.w3c.dom.ls.LSSerializer LSSerializer}
47  * follows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets&quot;&gt;Characters&lt;/a&gt; section
48  * of the XML Specification in handling characters output. In particular, the
49  * specification defined a character range that excluded the surrogate blocks.
50  * As a result, the JDK LSSerializer writes characters in the surrogate blocks
51  * as Character References. Character {@code 0xf0 0x9f 0x9a 0xa9}
52  * (Unicode code point U+1F6A9) for example will be written as {@code &amp;#128681;}.
53  *
54  * &lt;p&gt;
55  * This behavior is different from what was in the class description of
56  * {@link org.w3c.dom.ls.LSSerializer LSSerializer}. The relevant section is quoted
57  * below:
58  *
59  * &lt;p&gt;
60  * {@code Within the character data of a document (outside of markup), any characters
61  * that cannot be represented directly are replaced with character references...
62  * Any characters that cannot be represented directly in the output character encoding
63  * are serialized as numeric character references }
64  *
65  * &lt;p&gt;
66  * The JDK implementation does not follow this definition because it is not consistent
67  * with the XML Specification that defined an explicit character range with no
68  * association to the setting of the output character encoding.
69  *
70  *
71  * @since 1.4
