58 .SH DESCRIPTION
59 .PP
60 The \f[CB]jstack\f[R] command prints Java stack traces of Java threads for
61 a specified Java process.
62 For each Java frame, the full class name, method name, byte code index
63 (BCI), and line number, when available, are printed.
64 C++ mangled names aren\[aq]t demangled.
65 To demangle C++ names, the output of this command can be piped to
66 \f[CB]c++filt\f[R].
67 When the specified process is running on a 64\-bit JVM, you might need
68 to specify the \f[CB]\-J\-d64\f[R] option, for example:
69 \f[CB]jstack\ \-J\-d64\f[R] \f[I]pid\f[R].

71 \f[B]Note:\f[R]

73 This command is unsupported and might not be available in future
74 releases of the JDK.
