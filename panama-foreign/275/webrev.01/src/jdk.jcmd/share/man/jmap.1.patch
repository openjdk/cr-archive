 The process must be a Java process.
 To get a list of Java processes running on a machine, use either the
 \f[CB]ps\f[R] command or, if the JVM processes are not running in a
 separate docker instance, the \f[B]jps\f[R] command.

-\f[B]Note:\f[R] JDK 10 has added support for using the Attach API when
-attaching to Java processes running in a separate docker process.
-However, the \f[CB]jps\f[R] command will not list the JVM processes that
-are running in a separate docker instance.
-If you are trying to connect a Linux host with a Virtual Machine that is
-in a docker container, you must use tools such as \f[CB]ps\f[R] to look up
-the PID of the JVM.
