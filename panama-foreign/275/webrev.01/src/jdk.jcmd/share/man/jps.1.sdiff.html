 95 If the \f[CB]jps\f[R] command is run without specifying a \f[CB]hostid\f[R],
 96 then it searches for instrumented JVMs on the local host.
 97 If started with a \f[CB]hostid\f[R], then it searches for JVMs on the
 98 indicated host, using the specified protocol and port.
 99 A \f[CB]jstatd\f[R] process is assumed to be running on the target host.
100 .PP
101 The \f[CB]jps\f[R] command reports the local JVM identifier, or
102 \f[CB]lvmid\f[R], for each instrumented JVM found on the target system.
103 The \f[CB]lvmid\f[R] is typically, but not necessarily, the operating
104 system\[aq]s process identifier for the JVM process.
105 With no options, the \f[CB]jps\f[R] command lists each Java
106 application\[aq]s \f[CB]lvmid\f[R] followed by the short form of the
107 application\[aq]s class name or jar file name.
108 The short form of the class name or JAR file name omits the class\[aq]s
109 package information or the JAR files path information.
110 .PP
111 The \f[CB]jps\f[R] command uses the Java launcher to find the class name
112 and arguments passed to the main method.
113 If the target JVM is started with a custom launcher, then the class or
114 JAR file name, and the arguments to the \f[CB]main\f[R] method aren\[aq]t
