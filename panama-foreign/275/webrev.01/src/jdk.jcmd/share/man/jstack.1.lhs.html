47 separate docker instance, the \f[B]jps\f[R] command.

58 .SH DESCRIPTION
59 .PP
60 The \f[CB]jstack\f[R] command prints Java stack traces of Java threads for
61 a specified Java process.
62 For each Java frame, the full class name, method name, byte code index
63 (BCI), and line number, when available, are printed.
64 C++ mangled names aren\[aq]t demangled.
65 To demangle C++ names, the output of this command can be piped to
66 \f[CB]c++filt\f[R].
67 When the specified process is running on a 64\-bit JVM, you might need
68 to specify the \f[CB]\-J\-d64\f[R] option, for example:
69 \f[CB]jstack\ \-J\-d64\f[R] \f[I]pid\f[R].
70 .PP
71 \f[B]Note:\f[R]
72 .PP
73 This command is unsupported and might not be available in future
74 releases of the JDK.
75 In Windows Systems where the \f[CB]dbgeng.dll\f[R] file isn\[aq]t present,
76 the Debugging Tools for Windows must be installed so that these tools
77 work.
78 The \f[CB]PATH\f[R] environment variable needs to contain the location of
79 the \f[CB]jvm.dll\f[R] that is used by the target process, or the location
80 from which the core dump file was produced.
81 .SH OPTIONS FOR THE JSTACK COMMAND
