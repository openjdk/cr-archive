35 .TP
36 .B \f[I]options\f[R]

41 .TP
42 .B \f[I]pid\f[R]
43 The process ID for which the stack trace is printed.
44 The process must be a Java process.
45 To get a list of Java processes running on a machine, use either the
46 \f[CB]ps\f[R] command or, if the JVM processes are not running in a
47 separate docker instance, the \f[B]jps\f[R] command.

50 .SH DESCRIPTION
51 .PP
52 The \f[CB]jstack\f[R] command prints Java stack traces of Java threads for
53 a specified Java process.
54 For each Java frame, the full class name, method name, byte code index
55 (BCI), and line number, when available, are printed.
56 C++ mangled names aren\[aq]t demangled.
57 To demangle C++ names, the output of this command can be piped to
58 \f[CB]c++filt\f[R].
59 When the specified process is running on a 64\-bit JVM, you might need
60 to specify the \f[CB]\-J\-d64\f[R] option, for example:
61 \f[CB]jstack\ \-J\-d64\f[R] \f[I]pid\f[R].
62 .PP
63 \f[B]Note:\f[R]
64 .PP
65 This command is unsupported and might not be available in future
66 releases of the JDK.
67 In Windows Systems where the \f[CB]dbgeng.dll\f[R] file isn\[aq]t present,
68 the Debugging Tools for Windows must be installed so that these tools
69 work.
70 The \f[CB]PATH\f[R] environment variable needs to contain the location of
71 the \f[CB]jvm.dll\f[R] that is used by the target process, or the location
72 from which the core dump file was produced.
73 .SH OPTIONS FOR THE JSTACK COMMAND
74 .TP
75 .B \f[CB]\-l\f[R]
76 The long listing option prints additional information about locks.
