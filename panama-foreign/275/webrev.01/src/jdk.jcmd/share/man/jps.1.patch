 .SH SYNOPSIS
@@ -79,21 +79,10 @@
 The \f[CB]jps\f[R] command lists the instrumented Java HotSpot VMs on the
 target system.
 The command is limited to reporting information on JVMs for which it has
 the access permissions.
 .PP
-\f[B]Note:\f[R]
-.PP
-JDK 10 added support for using the Attach API when attaching to Java
-processes running in a separate docker process.
-However, the \f[CB]jps\f[R] tool cannot see JVM processes running in a
-separate docker instance.
-If you are trying to connect a Linux host with a Virtual Machine within
-a docker container, you must use tools such as \f[CB]ps\f[R] to look up
-the PID of the JVM and then specify the PID on the command line of the
-tools that accept the PID.
-.PP
 If the \f[CB]jps\f[R] command is run without specifying a \f[CB]hostid\f[R],
 then it searches for instrumented JVMs on the local host.
 If started with a \f[CB]hostid\f[R], then it searches for JVMs on the
 indicated host, using the specified protocol and port.
 A \f[CB]jstatd\f[R] process is assumed to be running on the target host.
