 32  * This class defines the &lt;i&gt;Service Provider Interface&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;b&gt;SPI&lt;/b&gt;)
 33  * for the &lt;code&gt;KeyAgreement&lt;/code&gt; class.
 34  * All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 35  * cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 36  * of a particular key agreement algorithm.
 37  *
 38  * &lt;p&gt; The keys involved in establishing a shared secret are created by one
 39  * of the
 40  * key generators (&lt;code&gt;KeyPairGenerator&lt;/code&gt; or
 41  * &lt;code&gt;KeyGenerator&lt;/code&gt;), a &lt;code&gt;KeyFactory&lt;/code&gt;, or as a result from
 42  * an intermediate phase of the key agreement protocol
 43  * ({@link #engineDoPhase(java.security.Key, boolean) engineDoPhase}).
 44  *
 45  * &lt;p&gt; For each of the correspondents in the key exchange,
 46  * &lt;code&gt;engineDoPhase&lt;/code&gt;
 47  * needs to be called. For example, if the key exchange is with one other
 48  * party, &lt;code&gt;engineDoPhase&lt;/code&gt; needs to be called once, with the
 49  * &lt;code&gt;lastPhase&lt;/code&gt; flag set to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.
 50  * If the key exchange is
 51  * with two other parties, &lt;code&gt;engineDoPhase&lt;/code&gt; needs to be called twice,
 52  * the first time setting the &lt;code&gt;lastPhase&lt;/code&gt; flag to
 53  * &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, and the second time setting it to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.
 54  * There may be any number of parties involved in a key exchange.
