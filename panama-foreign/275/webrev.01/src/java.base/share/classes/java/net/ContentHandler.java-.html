 31  * The abstract class {@code ContentHandler} is the superclass
 32  * of all classes that read an {@code Object} from a
 33  * {@code URLConnection}.
 34  * &lt;p&gt;
 35  * An application does not generally call the
 36  * {@code getContent} method in this class directly. Instead, an
 37  * application calls the {@code getContent} method in class
 38  * {@code URL} or in {@code URLConnection}.
 39  * The application&#39;s content handler factory (an instance of a class that
 40  * implements the interface {@code ContentHandlerFactory} set up by a call to
 41  * {@link URLConnection#setContentHandlerFactory(ContentHandlerFactory)
 42  * setContentHandlerFactory} is called with a {@code String} giving the
 43  * MIME type of the object being received on the socket. The factory returns an
 44  * instance of a subclass of {@code ContentHandler}, and its
 45  * {@code getContent} method is called to create the object.
 46  * &lt;p&gt;
 47  * If no content handler could be {@linkplain URLConnection#getContent() found},
 48  * URLConnection will look for a content handler in a user-definable set of places.
 49  * Users can define a vertical-bar delimited set of class prefixes
 50  * to search through by defining the &lt;i&gt;{@value java.net.URLConnection#contentPathProp}&lt;/i&gt;
 51  * property. The class name must be of the form:
 52  * &lt;blockquote&gt;
 53  *     &lt;i&gt;{package-prefix}.{major}.{minor}&lt;/i&gt;
 54  *     &lt;p&gt;
 55  *     where &lt;i&gt;{major}.{minor}&lt;/i&gt; is formed by taking the
 56  *     content-type string, replacing all slash characters with a
 57  *     {@code period} (&#39;.&#39;), and all other non-alphanumeric characters
 58  *     with the underscore character &#39;{@code _}&#39;. The alphanumeric
 59  *     characters are specifically the 26 uppercase ASCII letters
 60  *     &#39;{@code A}&#39; through &#39;{@code Z}&#39;, the 26 lowercase ASCII
 61  *     letters &#39;{@code a}&#39; through &#39;{@code z}&#39;, and the 10 ASCII
 62  *     digits &#39;{@code 0}&#39; through &#39;{@code 9}&#39;.
 63  *     &lt;p&gt;
 64  *     e.g.
 65  *     YoyoDyne.experimental.text.plain
 66  * &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 67  * If no user-defined content handler is found, then the system
 68  * tries to load a specific &lt;i&gt;content-type&lt;/i&gt; handler from one
 69  * of the built-in handlers, if one exists.
 70  * &lt;p&gt;
 71  * If the loading of the content handler class would be performed by
 72  * a classloader that is outside of the delegation chain of the caller,
 73  * the JVM will need the RuntimePermission &quot;getClassLoader&quot;.
