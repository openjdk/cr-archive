47 The \f[CB]rmiregistry\f[R] command creates and starts a remote object
48 registry on the specified port on the current host.

55 .RE
56 .PP
57 A remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service that\[aq]s used
58 by RMI servers on the same host to bind remote objects to names.
59 Clients on local and remote hosts can then look up remote objects and
60 make remote method invocations.
61 .PP
62 The registry is typically used to locate the first remote object on
63 which an application needs to call methods.
64 That object then provides application\-specific support for finding
65 other objects.
66 .PP
67 The methods of the \f[CB]java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry\f[R] class are
68 used to get a registry operating on the local host or local host and
69 port.
70 .PP
71 The URL\-based methods of the \f[CB]java.rmi.Naming\f[R] class operate on
72 a registry and can be used to:
73 .IP \[bu] 2
74 Bind the specified name to a remote object
75 .IP \[bu] 2
76 Return an array of the names bound in the registry
77 .IP \[bu] 2
78 Return a reference, a stub, for the remote object associated with the
79 specified name
80 .IP \[bu] 2
81 Rebind the specified name to a new remote object
82 .IP \[bu] 2
83 Destroy the binding for the specified name that\[aq]s associated with a
84 remote object
85 .SH OPTIONS

88 Used with any Java option to pass the \f[I]option\f[R] following the
