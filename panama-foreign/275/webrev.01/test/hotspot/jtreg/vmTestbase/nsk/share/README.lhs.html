 85 Naming conventions
 86 
 87 Classes:
 88 
 89     All shared classes are groupped into packages to prevent
 90     name collision.
 91 
 92     All classes exported directly from this directory are
 93     of package:
 94 
 95         nsk.share
 96 
 97     All classes exported from subdirectories are of particular
 98     subpackage, e.g.:
 99 
100         nsk.share.jpda
101         nsk.share.jdwp
102         nsk.share.jdi
103         nsk.share.jdb
104         nsk.share.sysdict
105 
106 Native functions and macroses:
107 
108     Most native functions have special prefix to prevent linking collisions.
109     Most macroses also have special prefix and are wrote in upper register.
110 
111     Here is typical naming scheme used for native functions and macroses:
112 
113         share/native
114             functions: nsk_*
115             macroses:  NSK_*
116 
117         share/jni
118             functions: nsk_jni_*
119             macroses:  NSK_JNI_*
120 
121         share/jvmti
122             functions: nsk_jvmti_*
123             macroses:  NSK_JVMTI_*
124 
125     However, some native functions and macroses do not follow this scheme,
126     in order to preserve compatibility with old tests.
