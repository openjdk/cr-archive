  1 % HotSpot Coding Style
  2 
  3 ## Introduction
  4 
  5 This is a collection of rules, guidelines, and suggestions for writing
  6 HotSpot code.  Following these will help new code fit in with existing
  7 HotSpot code, making it easier to read and maintain.  Failure to
  8 follow these guidelines may lead to discussion during code reviews, if
  9 not outright rejection of a change.
 10 
 11 ### Why Care About Style?
 12 
 13 Some programmers seem to have lexers and even C preprocessors
 14 installed directly behind their eyeballs. The rest of us require code
 15 that is not only functionally correct but also easy to read. More than
 16 that, since there is no one style for easy-to-read code, and since a
 17 mashup of many styles is just as confusing as no style at all, it is
 18 important for coders to be conscious of the many implicit stylistic
 19 choices that historically have gone into the HotSpot code base.
 20 
 21 Some of these guidelines are driven by the cross-platform requirements
 22 for HotSpot.  Shared code must work on a variety of platforms, and may
 23 encounter deficiencies in some.  Using platform conditionalization in
 24 shared code is usually avoided, while shared code is strongly
 25 preferred to multiple platform-dependent implementations, so some
 26 language features may be recommended against.
 27 
 28 Some of the guidelines here are relatively arbitrary choices among
 29 equally plausible alternatives.  The purpose of stating and enforcing
 30 these rules is largely to provide a consistent look to the code.  That
 31 consistency makes the code more readable by avoiding non-functional
 32 distractions from the interesting functionality.
 33 
 34 When changing pre-existing code, it is reasonable to adjust it to
 35 match these conventions. Exception: If the pre-existing code clearly
 36 conforms locally to its own peculiar conventions, it is not worth
 37 reformatting the whole thing.  Also consider separating changes that
 38 make extensive stylistic updates from those which make functional
 39 changes.
 40 
 41 ### Counterexamples and Updates
 42 
 43 Many of the guidelines mentioned here have (sometimes widespread)
 44 counterexamples in the HotSpot code base. Finding a counterexample is
 45 not sufficient justification for new code to follow the counterexample
 46 as a precedent, since readers of your code will rightfully expect your
 47 code to follow the greater bulk of precedents documented here.
 48 
 49 Occasionally a guideline mentioned here may be just out of synch with
 50 the actual HotSpot code base. If you find that a guideline is
 51 consistently contradicted by a large number of counterexamples, please
 52 bring it up for discussion and possible change. The architectural
 53 rule, of course, is &quot;When in Rome do as the Romans&quot;. Sometimes in the
 54 suburbs of Rome the rules are a little different; these differences
 55 can be pointed out here.
 56 
 57 Proposed changes should be discussed on the
 58 [HotSpot Developers](mailto:hotspot-dev@openjdk.java.net) mailing
 59 list, and approved by
 60 [rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus) of
 61 the [HotSpot Group](https://openjdk.java.net/census#hotspot) Members.
 62 The Group Lead determines whether consensus has been reached.
 63 Changes are likely to be cautious and incremental, since HotSpot
 64 coders have been using these guidelines for years.
 65 
 66 ## Structure and Formatting
 67 
 68 ### Factoring and Class Design
 69 
 70 * Group related code together, so readers can concentrate on one
 71 section of one file.
 72 
 73 * Classes are the primary code structuring mechanism.  Place related
 74 functionality in a class, or a set of related classes.  Use of either
 75 namespaces or public non-member functions is rare in HotSpot code.
 76 Static non-member functions are not uncommon.
 77 
 78 * If a class `FooBar` is going to be used in more than one place, put it
 79 a file named fooBar.hpp and fooBar.cpp. If the class is a sidekick
 80 to a more important class `BazBat`, it can go in bazBat.hpp.
 81 
 82 * Put a member function `FooBar::bang` into the same file that defined
 83 `FooBar`, or its associated *.inline.hpp or *.cpp file.
 84 
 85 * Use public accessor functions for member variables accessed
 86 outside the class.
 87 
 88 * Assign names to constant literals and use the names instead.
 89 
 90 * Keep functions small, a screenful at most.  Split out chunks of
 91 logic into file-local classes or static functions if needed.
 92 
 93 * Factor away nonessential complexity into local inline helper
 94 functions and helper classes.
 95 
 96 * Think clearly about internal invariants that apply to each class,
 97 and document them in the form of asserts within member functions.
 98 
 99 * Make simple, self-evident contracts for member functions.  If you cannot
100 communicate a simple contract, redesign the class.
101 
102 * Implement classes as if expecting rough usage by clients. Check for
103 incorrect usage of a class using `assert(...)`, `guarantee(...)`,
104 `ShouldNotReachHere()` and comments wherever needed.  Performance is
105 almost never a reason to omit asserts.
106 
107 * When possible, design as if for reusability.  This forces a clear
108 design of the class&#39;s externals, and clean hiding of its internals.
109 
110 * Initialize all variables and data structures to a known state. If a
111 class has a constructor, initialize it there.
112 
113 * Do no optimization before its time. Prove the need to optimize.
114 
115 * When you must defactor to optimize, preserve as much structure as
116 possible. If you must hand-inline some name, label the local copy with
117 the original name.
118 
119 * If you need to use a hidden detail (e.g., a structure offset), name
120 it (as a constant or function) in the class that owns it.
121 
122 * Don&#39;t use the Copy and Paste keys to replicate more than a couple
123 lines of code.  Name what you must repeat.
124 
125 * If a class needs a member function to change a user-visible attribute, the
126 change should be done with a &quot;setter&quot; accessor matched to the simple
127 &quot;getter&quot;.
128 
129 ### Files
130 
131 * All source files must have a globally unique basename.  The build
132 system depends on this uniqueness.
133 
134 * Do not put non-trivial function implementations in .hpp files. If
135 the implementation depends on other .hpp files, put it in a .cpp or
136 a .inline.hpp file.
137 
138 * .inline.hpp files should only be included in .cpp or .inline.hpp
139 files.
140 
141 * All .cpp files include precompiled.hpp as the first include line.
142 
143 * precompiled.hpp is just a build time optimization, so don&#39;t rely on
144 it to resolve include problems.
145 
146 * Keep the include lines alphabetically sorted.
147 
148 * Put conditional inclusions (`#if ...`) at the end of the include list.
149 
150 ### Naming
151 
152 * The length of a name may be correlated to the size of its scope.  In
153 particular, short names (even single letter names) may be fine in a
154 small scope, but are usually inappropriate for larger scopes.
155 
156 * Prefer whole words rather than abbreviations, unless the
157 abbreviation is more widely used than the long form in the code&#39;s
158 domain.
159 
160 * Choose names consistently. Do not introduce spurious
161 variations. Abbreviate corresponding terms to a consistent length.
162 
163 * Global names must be unique, to avoid [One Definition Rule][ODR] (ODR)
164 violations.  A common prefixing scheme for related global names is
165 often used.  (This is instead of using namespaces, which are mostly
166 avoided in HotSpot.)
167 
168 * Don&#39;t give two names to the semantically same thing.  But use
169 different names for semantically different things, even if they are
170 representationally the same.  (So use meaningful `typedef` or template
171 alias names where appropriate.)
172 
173 * When choosing names, avoid categorical nouns like &quot;variable&quot;,
174 &quot;field&quot;, &quot;parameter&quot;, &quot;value&quot;, and verbs like &quot;compute&quot;, &quot;get&quot;.
175 (`storeValue(int param)` is bad.)
176 
177 * Type names and global names should use mixed-case with the first
178 letter of each word capitalized (`FooBar`).
179 
180 * Embedded abbreviations in
181 otherwise mixed-case names are usually capitalized entirely rather
182 than being treated as a single word with only the initial letter
183 capitalized, e.g. &quot;HTML&quot; rather than &quot;Html&quot;.
184 
185 * Function and local variable names use lowercase with words separated
186 by a single underscore (`foo_bar`).
187 
188 * Class data member names have a leading underscore, and use lowercase
189 with words separated by a single underscore (`_foo_bar`).
190 
191 * Constant names may be upper-case or mixed-case, according to
192 historical necessity.  (Note: There are many examples of constants
193 with lowercase names.)
194 
195 * Constant names should follow an existing pattern, and must have a
196 distinct appearance from other names in related APIs.
197 
198 * Class and type names should be noun phrases. Consider an &quot;er&quot; suffix
199 for a class that represents an action.
200 
201 * Function names should be verb phrases that reflect changes of state
202 known to a class&#39;s user, or else noun phrases if they cause no change
203 of state visible to the class&#39;s user.
204 
205 * Getter accessor names are noun phrases, with no &quot;`get_`&quot; noise
206 word. Boolean getters can also begin with &quot;`is_`&quot; or &quot;`has_`&quot;.  Member
207 function for reading data members usually have the same name as the
208 data member, exclusive of the leading underscore.
209 
210 * Setter accessor names prepend &quot;`set_`&quot; to the getter name.
211 
212 * Other member function names are verb phrases, as if commands to the receiver.
213 
214 * Avoid leading underscores (as &quot;`_oop`&quot;) except in cases required
215 above. (Names with leading underscores can cause portability
216 problems.)
217 
218 ### Commenting
219 
220 * Clearly comment subtle fixes.
221 
222 * Clearly comment tricky classes and functions.
223 
224 * If you have to choose between commenting code and writing wiki
225 content, comment the code. Link from the wiki to the source file if
226 it makes sense.
227 
228 * As a general rule don&#39;t add bug numbers to comments (they would soon
229 overwhelm the code). But if the bug report contains significant
230 information that can&#39;t reasonably be added as a comment, then refer to
231 the bug report.
232 
233 * Personal names are discouraged in the source code, which is a team
234 product.
235 
236 ### Macros
237 
238 * You can almost always use an inline function or class instead of a
239 macro. Use a macro only when you really need it.
240 
241 * Templates may be preferable to multi-line macros. (There may be
242 subtle performance effects with templates on some platforms; revert
243 to macros if absolutely necessary.)
244 
245 * `#ifdef`s should not be used to introduce platform-specific code
246 into shared code (except for `_LP64`). They must be used to manage
247 header files, in the pattern found at the top of every source
248 file. They should be used mainly for major build features, including
249 `PRODUCT`, `ASSERT`, `_LP64`, `INCLUDE_SERIALGC`, `COMPILER1`, etc.
250 
251 * For build features such as `PRODUCT`, use `#ifdef PRODUCT` for
252 multiple-line inclusions or exclusions.
253 
254 * For short inclusions or exclusions based on build features, use
255 macros like `PRODUCT_ONLY` and `NOT_PRODUCT`. But avoid using them
256 with multiple-line arguments, since debuggers do not handle that
257 well.
258 
259 * Use `CATCH`, `THROW`, etc. for HotSpot-specific exception processing.
260 
261 ### Whitespace
262 
263 * In general, don&#39;t change whitespace unless it improves readability
264 or consistency.  Gratuitous whitespace changes will make integrations
265 and backports more difficult.
266 
267 * Use One-True-Brace-Style. The opening brace for a function or class
268 is normally at the end of the line; it is sometimes moved to the
269 beginning of the next line for emphasis.  Substatements are enclosed
270 in braces, even if there is only a single statement.  Extremely simple
271 one-line statements may drop braces around a substatement.
272 
273 * Indentation levels are two columns.
274 
275 * There is no hard line length limit.  That said, bear in mind that
276 excessively long lines can cause difficulties.  Some people like to
277 have multiple side-by-side windows in their editors, and long lines
278 may force them to choose among unpleasant options. They can use wide
279 windows, reducing the number that can fit across the screen, and
280 wasting a lot of screen real estate because most lines are not that
281 long.  Alternatively, they can have more windows across the screen,
282 with long lines wrapping (or worse, requiring scrolling to see in
283 their entirety), which is harder to read.  Similar issues exist for
284 side-by-side code reviews.
285 
286 * Tabs are not allowed in code. Set your editor accordingly.&lt;br&gt;
287 (Emacs: `(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)`.)
288 
289 * Use good taste to break lines and align corresponding tokens on
290 adjacent lines.
291 
292 * Use spaces around operators, especially comparisons and
293 assignments. (Relaxable for boolean expressions and high-precedence
294 operators in classic math-style formulas.)
295 
296 * Put spaces on both sides of control flow keywords `if`, `else`,
297 `for`, `switch`, etc.  Don&#39;t add spaces around the associated
298 _control_ expressions.  Examples:
299 
300     ```
301     while (test_foo(args...)) {   // Yes
302     while(test_foo(args...)) {    // No, missing space after while
303     while ( test_foo(args...) ) { // No, excess spaces around control
304     ```
305 
306 * Use extra parentheses in expressions whenever operator precedence
307 seems doubtful. Always use parentheses in shift/mask expressions
308 (`&lt;&lt;`, `&amp;`, `|`).  Don&#39;t add whitespace immediately inside
309 parentheses.
310 
311 * Use more spaces and blank lines between larger constructs, such as
312 classes or function definitions.
313 
314 * If the surrounding code has any sort of vertical organization,
315 adjust new lines horizontally to be consistent with that
316 organization. (E.g., trailing backslashes on long macro definitions
317 often align.)
318 
319 ### Miscellaneous
320 
321 * Use the [Resource Acquisition Is Initialization][RAII] (RAII)
322 design pattern to manage bracketed critical
323 sections. See class `ResourceMark` for an example.
324 
325 * Avoid implicit conversions to `bool`.
326     * Use `bool` for boolean values.
327     * Do not use ints or pointers as (implicit) booleans with `&amp;&amp;`, `||`,
328       `if`, `while`. Instead, compare explicitly, i.e. `if (x != 0)` or
329       `if (ptr != nullptr)`, etc.
330     * Do not use declarations in _condition_ forms, i.e. don&#39;t use
331       `if (T v = value) { ... }`.
332 
333 * Use functions from globalDefinitions.hpp and related files when
334 performing bitwise
335 operations on integers. Do not code directly as C operators, unless
336 they are extremely simple. (Examples: `align_up`, `is_power_of_2`,
337 `exact_log2`.)
338 
339 * Use arrays with abstractions supporting range checks.
340 
341 * Always enumerate all cases in a switch statement or provide a default
342 case. It is ok to have an empty default with comment.
343 
344 
345 ## Use of C++ Features
346 
347 HotSpot was originally written in a subset of the C++98/03 language.
348 More recently, support for C++14 is provided, though again,
349 HotSpot only uses a subset.  (Backports to JDK versions lacking
350 support for more recent Standards must of course stick with the
351 original C++98/03 subset.)
352 
353 This section describes that subset.  Features from the C++98/03
354 language may be used unless explicitly excluded here.  Features from
355 C++11 and C++14 may be explicitly permitted or explicitly excluded,
356 and discussed accordingly here.  There is a third category, undecided
357 features, about which HotSpot developers have not yet reached a
358 consensus, or perhaps have not discussed at all.  Use of these
359 features is also excluded.
360 
361 (The use of some features may not be immediately obvious and may slip
362 in anyway, since the compiler will accept them.  The code review
363 process is the main defense against this.)
364 
365 Some features are discussed in their own subsection, typically to provide
366 more extensive discussion or rationale for limitations.  Features that
367 don&#39;t have their own subsection are listed in omnibus feature sections
368 for permitted, excluded, and undecided features.
369 
370 Lists of new features for C++11 and C++14, along with links to their
371 descriptions, can be found in the online documentation for some of the
372 compilers and libraries.  The C++14 Standard is the definitive
373 description.
374 
375 * [C++ Standards Support in GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html)
376 * [C++ Support in Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html)
377 * [Visual C++ Language Conformance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/visual-cpp-language-conformance)
378 * [libstdc++ Status](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/status.html)
379 * [libc++ Status](https://libcxx.llvm.org/cxx1y_status.html)
380 
381 As a rule of thumb, permitting features which simplify writing code
382 and, especially, reading code, is encouraged.
383

397 
398 ### Error Handling
399 
400 Do not use exceptions. Exceptions are disabled by the build configuration
401 for some platforms.
402 
403 Rationale: There is significant concern over the performance cost of
404 exceptions and their usage model and implications for maintainable code.
405 That&#39;s not just a matter of history that has been fixed; there remain
406 questions and problems even today (2019). See, for example, [Zero cost
407 deterministic
408 exceptions](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf).
409 Because of this, HotSpot has always used a build configuration that disables
410 exceptions where that is available. As a result, HotSpot code uses error
411 handling mechanisms such as two-phase construction, factory functions,
412 returning error codes, and immediate termination. Even if the cost of
413 exceptions were not a concern, the existing body of code was not written with
414 exception safety in mind. Making HotSpot exception safe would be a very large
415 undertaking.
416 
417 In addition to the usual alternatives to exceptions, HotSpot provides its
418 own exception mechanism. This is based on a set of macros defined in
419 utilities/exceptions.hpp.
420 
421 ### RTTI (Runtime Type Information)
422 
423 Do not use [Runtime Type Information][RTTI] (RTTI).
424 [RTTI][] is disabled by the build configuration for some
425 platforms.  Among other things, this means `dynamic_cast` cannot be used.
426 
427 Rationale: Other than to implement exceptions (which HotSpot doesn&#39;t use),
428 most potential uses of [RTTI][] are better done via virtual functions.  Some of
429 the remainder can be replaced by bespoke mechanisms.  The cost of the
430 additional runtime data structures needed to support [RTTI][] are deemed not
431 worthwhile, given the alternatives.
432 
433 ### Memory Allocation
434 
435 Do not use the standard global allocation and deallocation functions
436 (operator new and related functions).  Use of these functions by HotSpot
437 code is disabled for some platforms.
438 
439 Rationale: HotSpot often uses &quot;resource&quot; or &quot;arena&quot; allocation.  Even
440 where heap allocation is used, the standard global functions are
441 avoided in favor of wrappers around malloc and free that support the
442 VM&#39;s Native Memory Tracking (NMT) feature.
443 
444 Native memory allocation failures are often treated as non-recoverable.
445 The place where &quot;out of memory&quot; is (first) detected may be an innocent
446 bystander, unrelated to the actual culprit.
447 
448 ### Class Inheritance
449 
450 Use public single inheritance.
451 
452 Prefer composition rather than non-public inheritance.
453 
454 Restrict inheritance to the &quot;is-a&quot; case; use composition rather than
455 non-is-a related inheritance.
456 
457 Avoid multiple inheritance.  Never use virtual inheritance.
458 
459 ### Namespaces
460 
461 Avoid using namespaces.  HotSpot code normally uses &quot;all static&quot;
462 classes rather than namespaces for grouping.  An &quot;all static&quot; class is
463 not instantiable, has only static members, and is normally derived
464 (possibly indirectly) from the helper class `AllStatic`.
465 
466 Benefits of using such classes include:
467 
468 * Provides access control for members, which is unavailable with
469 namespaces.
470 
471 * Avoids [Argument Dependent Lookup][ADL] (ADL).
472 
473 * Closed for additional members.  Namespaces allow names to be added in
474 multiple contexts, making it harder to see the complete API.
475 
476 Namespaces should be used only in cases where one of those &quot;benefits&quot;
477 is actually a hindrance.
478 
479 In particular, don&#39;t use anonymous namespaces.  They seem like they should
480 be useful, and indeed have some real benefits for naming and generated code
481 size on some platforms.  Unfortunately, debuggers don&#39;t seem to like them at
482 all.
483 
484 &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/KsaG3lEEaRM&gt;&lt;br&gt;
485 Suggests Visual Studio debugger might not be able to refer to
486 anonymous namespace symbols, so can&#39;t set breakpoints in them.
487 Though the discussion seems to go back and forth on that.
488 
489 &lt;https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/code-quality/coding-style/coding_style_cpp.html&gt;&lt;br&gt;
490 Search for &quot;Anonymous namespaces&quot;
491 Suggests preferring &quot;static&quot; to anonymous namespaces where applicable,
492 because of poor debugger support for anonymous namespaces.

495 Bug for similar gdb problems.
496 
497 ### C++ Standard Library
498 
499 Avoid using the C++ Standard Library.
500 
501 Historically, HotSpot has mostly avoided use of the Standard
502 Library.
503 
504 (It used to be impossible to use most of it in shared code,
505 because the build configuration for Solaris with Solaris Studio made
506 all but a couple of pieces inaccessible.  Support for header-only
507 parts was added in mid-2017.  Support for Solaris was removed
508 in 2020.)
509 
510 Some reasons for this include
511 
512 * Exceptions. Perhaps the largest core issue with adopting the use of
513 Standard Library facilities is exceptions. HotSpot does not use
514 exceptions and, for platforms which allow doing so, builds with them
515 turned off.  Many Standard Library facilities implicitly or explicitly
516 use exceptions.
517 
518 * `assert`.  An issue that is quickly encountered is the `assert` macro name
519 collision ([JDK-8007770](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8007770)).
520 Some mechanism for addressing this would be needed before much of the
521 Standard Library could be used.  (Not all Standard Library implementations
522 use assert in header files, but some do.)
523 
524 * Memory allocation. HotSpot requires explicit control over where
525 allocations occur. The C++98/03 `std::allocator` class is too limited
526 to support our usage.  (Changes in more recent Standards may remove
527 this limitation.)
528 
529 * Implementation vagaries. Bugs, or simply different implementation choices,
530 can lead to different behaviors among the various Standard Libraries we need
531 to deal with.
532 
533 * Inconsistent naming conventions. HotSpot and the C++ Standard use
534 different naming conventions. The coexistence of those different conventions
535 might appear jarring and reduce readability.
536 
537 There are a few exceptions to this rule.
538 
539 * `#include &lt;new&gt;` to use placement `new`, `std::nothrow`, and `std::nothrow_t`.
540 * `#include &lt;limits&gt;` to use `std::numeric_limits`.
541 * `#include &lt;type_traits&gt;`.
542 * `#include &lt;cstddef&gt;` to use `std::nullptr_t`.
543 
544 TODO: Rather than directly \#including (permitted) Standard Library
545 headers, use a convention of \#including wrapper headers (in some
546 location like hotspot/shared/stdcpp).  This provides a single place
547 for dealing with issues we might have for any given header, esp.
548 platform-specific issues.
549 
550 ### Type Deduction
551 
552 Use type deduction only if it makes the code clearer or safer.  Do not
553 use it merely to avoid the inconvenience of writing an explicit type,
554 unless that type is itself difficult to write.  An example of the
555 latter is a function template return type that depends on template
556 parameters in a non-trivial way.
557 
558 There are several contexts where types are deduced.
559 
560 * Function argument deduction.  This is always permitted, and indeed
561 encouraged.  It is nearly always better to allow the type of a
562 function template argument to be deduced rather than explicitly
563 specified.
564 
565 * `auto` variable declarations
566 ([n1984](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1984.pdf))&lt;br&gt;
567 For local variables, this can be used to make the code clearer by
568 eliminating type information that is obvious or irrelevant.  Excessive
569 use can make code much harder to understand.
570 
571 * Function return type deduction
572 ([n3638](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3638.html))&lt;br&gt;
573 Only use if the function body has a very small number of `return`
574 statements, and generally relatively little other code.
575 
576 * Generic lambdas.  Lambdas are not (yet) permitted.
577 
578 * Lambda init captures.  Lambdas are not (yet) permitted.
579 
580 ### Expression SFINAE
581 
582 [Substitution Failure Is Not An Error][SFINAE] (SFINAE)
583 is a template metaprogramming technique that makes use of
584 template parameter substitution failures to make compile-time decisions.
585 
586 C++11 relaxed the rules for what constitutes a hard-error when
587 attempting to substitute template parameters with template arguments,
588 making most deduction errors be substitution errors; see
589 ([n2634](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2634.html)).
590 This makes [SFINAE][] more powerful and easier to use.  However, the
591 implementation complexity for this change is significant, and this
592 seems to be a place where obscure corner-case bugs in various
593 compilers can be found.  So while this feature can (and indeed should)
594 be used (and would be difficult to avoid), caution should be used when
595 pushing to extremes.
596 
597 Here are a few closely related example bugs:&lt;br&gt;
598 &lt;https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95468&gt;&lt;br&gt;
599 &lt;https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/396562/sizeof-deduced-type-is-sometimes-not-a-constant-ex.html&gt;
600 
601 ### enum
602 
603 Where appropriate, _scoped-enums_ should be used.
604 ([n2347](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2347.pdf)) 
605 
606 Use of _unscoped-enums_ is permitted, though ordinary constants may be
607 preferable when the automatic initializer feature isn&#39;t used.
608 
609 The underlying type (the _enum-base_) of an unscoped enum type should
610 always be specified explicitly.  When unspecified, the underlying type
611 is dependent on the range of the enumerator values and the platform.
612 
613 The underlying type of a _scoped-enum_ should also be specified
614 explicitly if conversions may be applied to values of that type.
615 
616 Due to bugs in certain (very old) compilers, there is widespread use
617 of enums and avoidance of in-class initialization of static integral
618 constant members.  Compilers having such bugs are no longer supported.
619 Except where an enum is semantically appropriate, new code should use
620 integral constants.
621 
622 ### thread_local
623 
624 Do not use `thread_local`
625 ([n2659](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2659.htm));
626 instead, use the HotSpot macro `THREAD_LOCAL`.  The initializer must
627 be a constant expression.
628 
629 As was discussed in the review for
630 [JDK-8230877](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/hotspot-dev/2019-September/039487.html),
631 `thread_local` allows dynamic initialization and destruction
632 semantics.  However, that support requires a run-time penalty for
633 references to non-function-local `thread_local` variables defined in a
634 different translation unit, even if they don&#39;t need dynamic
635 initialization.  Dynamic initialization and destruction of
636 namespace-scoped thread local variables also has the same ordering
637 problems as for ordinary namespace-scoped variables.
638 
639 ### nullptr
640 
641 Prefer `nullptr`
642 ([n2431](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2431.pdf))
643 to `NULL`.  Don&#39;t use (constexpr or literal) 0 for pointers. 
644 
645 For historical reasons there are widespread uses of both `NULL` and of
646 integer 0 as a pointer value.
647 
648 ### &amp;lt;atomic&amp;gt;
649 
650 Do not use facilities provided by the `&lt;atomic&gt;` header
651 ([n2427](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2427.html)),
652 ([n2752](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2752.htm));
653 instead, use the HotSpot `Atomic` class and related facilities.
654 
655 Atomic operations in HotSpot code must have semantics which are
656 consistent with those provided by the JDK&#39;s compilers for Java.  There
657 are platform-specific implementation choices that a C++ compiler might
658 make or change that are outside the scope of the C++ Standard, and
659 might differ from what the Java compilers implement.
660 
661 In addition, HotSpot `Atomic` has a concept of &quot;conservative&quot; memory
662 ordering, which may differ from (may be stronger than) sequentially
663 consistent.  There are algorithms in HotSpot that are believed to rely
664 on that ordering.
665 
666 ### Additional Permitted Features
667 
668 * `constexpr`
669 ([n2235](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2235.pdf)) 
670 ([n3652](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3652.html))
671 
672 * Sized deallocation
673 ([n3778](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/n3778.html))
674 
675 * Variadic templates
676 ([n2242](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2242.pdf))
677 ([n2555](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2555.pdf))
678 
679 * Static assertions
680 ([n1720](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1720.html))
681 
682 * `decltype`
683 ([n2343](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2343.pdf))
684 ([n3276](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3276.pdf))
685 
686 * Right angle brackets
687 ([n1757](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1757.html))
688 
689 * Default template arguments for function templates
690 ([CWG D226](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_defects.html#226))
691 
692 * Template aliases
693 ([n2258](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2258.pdf))
694 
695 * Delegating constructors
696 ([n1986](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1986.pdf))
697 
698 * Explicit conversion operators
699 ([n2437](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2437.pdf))
700 
701 * Standard Layout Types
702 ([n2342](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2342.htm))
703 
704 * Defaulted and deleted functions
705 ([n2346](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2346.htm))
706 
707 * Dynamic initialization and destruction with concurrency
708 ([n2660](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2660.htm))
709 
710 * `final` virtual specifiers for classes and virtual functions
711 ([n2928](http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2009/n2928.htm)),
712 ([n3206](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3206.htm)),
713 ([n3272](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3272.htm))
714 
715 * Local and unnamed types as template parameters
716 ([n2657](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2657.htm))
717 
718 ### Excluded Features
719 
720 * New string and character literals
721     * New character types
722     ([n2249](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2249.html))
723     * Unicode string literals
724     ([n2442](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2442.htm))
725     * Raw string literals
726     ([n2442](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2442.htm))
727     * Universal character name literals
728     ([n2170](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2170.html))
729 
730     HotSpot doesn&#39;t need any of the new character and string literal
731     types.
732 
733 * User-defined literals
734 ([n2765](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2765.pdf)) &amp;mdash;
735 User-defined literals should not be added casually, but only
736 through a proposal to add a specific UDL.
737 
738 * Inline namespaces
739 ([n2535](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2535.htm)) &amp;mdash;
740 HotSpot makes very limited use of namespaces.
741 
742 * `using namespace` directives.  In particular, don&#39;t use `using
743 namespace std;` to avoid needing to qualify Standard Library names.
744 
745 * Propagating exceptions
746 ([n2179](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2179.html)) &amp;mdash;
747 HotSpot does not permit the use of exceptions, so this feature isn&#39;t useful.
748 
749 * Avoid namespace-scoped variables with non-constexpr initialization.
750 In particular, avoid variables with types requiring non-trivial
751 initialization or destruction.  Initialization order problems can be
752 difficult to deal with and lead to surprises, as can destruction
753 ordering.  HotSpot doesn&#39;t generally try to cleanup on exit, and
754 running destructors at exit can also lead to problems.
755 
756 * `[[deprecated]]` attribute
757 ([n3760](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3760.html)) &amp;mdash;
758 Not relevant in HotSpot code.
759 
760 * Avoid most operator overloading, preferring named functions.  When
761 operator overloading is used, ensure the semantics conform to the
762 normal expected behavior of the operation.
763 
764 * Avoid most implicit conversion constructors and (implicit or explicit)
765 conversion operators.  (Note that conversion to `bool` isn&#39;t needed
766 in HotSpot code because of the &quot;no implicit boolean&quot; guideline.)
767 
768 * Avoid covariant return types.
769 
770 * Avoid `goto` statements. 
771 
772 ### Undecided Features
773 
774 This list is incomplete; it serves to explicitly call out some
775 features that have not yet been discussed.
776 
777 * `overrides` virtual specifiers for virtual functions 
778 ([n3272](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3272.htm))
779 
780 * Trailing return type syntax for functions 
781 ([n2541](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2541.htm))
782 
783 * Variable templates
784 ([n3651](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3651.pdf))
785 
786 * Member initializers and aggregates
787 ([n3653](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3653.html))
788 
789 * `[[noreturn]]` attribute
790 ([n2761](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2761.pdf))
791 
792 * Rvalue references and move semantics
