 33 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 34 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 35 
 36 - hgbridge - continuously convert Mercurial repositories to git
 37 - mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
 38 - notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
 39 - pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
 40 - submit - example pull request test runner
 41 - forward - forward commits to various repositories
 42 - mirror - mirror repositories
 43 - merge - merge commits between different repositories and/or branches
 44 - test - test runner
 45 
 46 ## Building
 47 
 48 [JDK 14](http://jdk.java.net/14/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
<span class="line-modified"> 49 6.4.1 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or</span>
 50 GNU/Linux x64, just run the following command from the source tree root:
 51 
 52 ```bash
 53 $ sh gradlew
 54 ```
 55 
 56 To build the project on Windows x64, run the following command from the source tree root:
 57 
 58 ```bat
 59 &gt; gradlew
 60 ```
 61 
 62 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 63 tree root. _Note_ that the above commands will build the CLI tools, if you
 64 also want to build the bot images run `sh gradlew images` on GNU/Linux or
 65 `gradlew images` on Windows.
 66 
 67 ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
 68 
 69 If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
 70 Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
 71 ensure that you have JDK 14 or later installed locally. You can then run the
 72 following command from the source tree root:
 73 
 74 ```bash
 75 $ sh gradlew
 76 ```
 77 
 78 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 79 tree root.
 80 
 81 ### Offline builds
 82 
 83 If you don&#39;t want the build to automatically download any dependencies, then
 84 you must ensure that you have installed the following software locally:
 85 
 86 - JDK 14 or later
<span class="line-modified"> 87 - Gradle 6.4.1 or later</span>
 88 
 89 To create a build then run the command:
 90 
 91 ```bash
 92 $ gradle offline
 93 ```
 94 
 95 _Please note_ that the above command does _not_ make use of `gradlew` to avoid
 96 downloading Gradle.
 97 
 98 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 99 tree root.
100 
101 ### Cross-linking
102 
103 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
104 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
105 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
106 source tree root:
